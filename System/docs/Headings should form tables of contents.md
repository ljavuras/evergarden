# Headings should form tables of contents

- The first H1 title should be **the title** of the document, instead of relying on filename. This provides a nice table of contents in outline view provided by core plugin *Outline*.
- **Do not** use headings for styling.
- Semantic coherence assures notes works correctly with other tools.
